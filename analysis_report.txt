• Forecast uncertainty: High
• Model convergence: Successfully converged

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Data Collection & Management:
   - Continue quarterly monitoring of capital importation
   - Consider collecting monthly data for higher-frequency analysis
   - Maintain data quality checks for outliers and inconsistencies

2. Modeling Improvements:
   - Consider SARIMA model for better seasonal capture
   - Consider log transformation for skewed data
   - Update model quarterly with new data for improved accuracy

3. Forecasting Best Practices:
   - Use confidence intervals for risk assessment
   - Monitor forecast errors and adjust models as needed
   - Consider multiple forecasting methods for comparison
   - Incorporate external economic indicators when available

4. Strategic Applications:
   - Use forecasts for budgeting and resource allocation
   - Monitor for structural breaks in capital flows
   - Align policy decisions with capital flow projections

LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS
---------------------
1. Data Limitations:
   - Limited historical data (47 quarters)
   - Potential reporting lags in official statistics
   - Aggregation may mask sectoral trends

2. Model Limitations:
   - ARIMA assumes linear relationships
   - Does not account for external shocks or policy changes
   - Confidence intervals may understate true uncertainty

3. Forecast Limitations:
   - Accuracy decreases further into the future
   - Assumes continuation of historical patterns
   - Does not incorporate forward-looking information
